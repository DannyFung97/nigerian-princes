    "#### Background\n",
    "* Scam callers can spoof their caller ID to make it look like they are from your area.\n",
    "* Scam callers can target victims based on certain demographics such as race.\n",
    "* Scam callers sometimes do not take people off their call lists when requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prior Work\n",
    "We found two projects similar to ours: **The Large-Scale Analysis of Technical Support Scams** and **The Correlates of Susceptibility to Scams in Older Adults Without Dementia**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Large-Scale Analysis of Technical Support Scams** study learned that scammers abuse specific browser APIs to make it hard for users to navigate away from a technical support scam page, identified the social engineering techniques used, the remote administration tools abused, and the amount of money that scammers are charging. Technical support scammers were also based in call centers in English-speaking countries with low wages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Correlates of Susceptibility to Scams in Older Adults Without Dementia** study found that the oldest old, persons with lower levels of cognitive function, lower psychological well being, and poorer health and financial literacy appeared to be the most susceptible to scams, independent of the level of education and income. There was no difference in susceptibility between males and females. This study identifies a number of factors that may put older adults at high risk of falling prey to scams, and suggests at least two modifiable factors—health and financial literacy and well-being—as potential targets for interventions to prevent victimization of older persons. The most robust psychosocial correlate of susceptibility to scams was psychological well-being. This indicates that positive functioning and outlook on one's life is associated with being less susceptible to being taken advantage of by a scammer.\n",
